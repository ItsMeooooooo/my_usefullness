Comment:      : I did not test for POSIX Compliance
                Most of the time I work in RHEL/ CentOS
                Environments. Simply place the File
                in your /etc/profile.d and it should be
                parsed properly. You'll experience 
                a different Behavior on Debian based
                Distros. Here you have to edit
                /etc/profile and add:

                if [ -d /etc/profile.d ]; then
                      for i in /etc/profile.d/*.sh; do
                              if [ -r $i ]; then
                                      .  $i
                              fi
                      done
                      unset i
                fi
